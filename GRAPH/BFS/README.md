This project is sliding puzzle game in which we have to move the tile to increasing sequence. With the help of graph and bfs algorithm the project or game is able to tell minimome moves required to solve the puzzle if you got try some other moves  it means either there is no possible moves or the possible moves you will see after moving some tile. In each move the algo has to check what is min moves so the complexity is very high and that's why you see lagging sometimes.
