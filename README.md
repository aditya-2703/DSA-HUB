## Dsa-Hub is all about how you can use different data-structures and algorithms to solve reallife application and building reallife projects and games. With this idea and concept i build games and projects  based on specific data-structure and algorithm



--------

### The different data-structues and algorithms by which i build projects are
* [Arrays - 2048](https://github.com/aditya-2703/DSA-HUB/tree/main/ARRAY%20-%20MATRIX)
* [Stack - Card Stack](https://github.com/aditya-2703/DSA-HUB/tree/main/STACK)
* [Queue - Music Queue](https://github.com/aditya-2703/DSA-HUB/tree/main/QUEUE)
* [Linked List - Snake Game](https://github.com/aditya-2703/DSA-HUB/tree/main/LINKED_LIST)
* [Sorting - Sorting Visualizer](https://github.com/aditya-2703/DSA-HUB/tree/main/SORTING)
* [Searching - Number Guessing](https://github.com/aditya-2703/DSA-HUB/tree/main/SEARCHING)
* [String - Typing Game](https://github.com/aditya-2703/DSA-HUB/tree/main/STRING)
* [Backtracking - Suduko Solver](https://github.com/aditya-2703/DSA-HUB/tree/main/BACKTRACKING)
* [Bit Magic - Bit Calculator](https://github.com/aditya-2703/DSA-HUB/tree/main/BIT-MAGIC)
