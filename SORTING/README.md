This project is Sorting visualizer to understand how different sorting algorithms work this visualizer includes bubble-sort,selection-sort,insertion-sort,shell-sort,quick-sort,merge-sort sorting algorithms.

# How to run app 

 * This is simple website with vanila javascript so you can directly run on your local machine without downloading any additional framework.
 * If you want to edite then it is better to use sass compiler because scss is used here. 

# How to run modules

 * In order to start visualizer you have to press start button.
 * after pressing start select your algo and press go.
 * after pressing go button you can adjust the speed of visualizer and the size of bars low to high.
 * you can also randomize the bars anytime by pressing the randomize button.
 * After pressing start you can see visualizer of your algo.
