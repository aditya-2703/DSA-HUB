-Rule info
    - First both player has given equal cards (52/2 = 26 26)
    - one by one turn wise players put top cards into floor 
    - if top card of floor matches the top of card of player which has turn then the all floor card gives to that player
    - if any one of player has zero card left then game ends and the opposite player wins

-How it works
    - there is 3 stacks
    - 1 for player 1
        - each time when player 1 has turn then the top of card pops and push into floor stack
        - each time also we first checks that peep of this and floor is equal or not if equal then the whole floor stack is pushed into this stack
    - 2 for player 2
        - each time when player 2 has turn then the top of card pops and push into floor stack
        - each time also we first checks that peep of this and floor is equal or not if equal then the whole floor stack is pushed into this stack
    - 3 for floor 
        - each time if card matches (top of card) then we clear this stack and push all the element to those player
        - if cards does not matches then will simply push that cards into this stack
    - score 
        - it shows how many cards each player have to remind player
    - Here will use
        - stack
            - push - to insert element
            - pop  - to delete  or remove element
            - peep - to get the top most element
